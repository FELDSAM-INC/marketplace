    ## Features
    1. NAT iptables masquerading enabled by new context var `ETHx_VROUTER_GATEWAY = "YES"`
    2. Keepalived email notifications:
    	* `VROUTER_KEEPALIVED_NOTIFY_EMAIL` - required to enable this feature
    	* `VROUTER_KEEPALIVED_FROM_EMAIL` - optional, if not defined emails are send from `NOTIFY_EMAIL` address
    3. Keepalived can define sync interface using var `ETHx_VROUTER_KEEPALIVED_INF` - usefull if you need save some public IPv4 addresses or just want all vrrp traffix on private interface. *For saving addresses need integration in OpenNebula*
    4. Keepalived Load Ballancing support
    	* both NAT and DR (Direct Routing)
    	* Single and Multi Port support using firewall marks
    	* FTP Passive support using multiport, fwmarks and ip\_vs\_ftp module
    	* Context vars in following format `VROUTER_LB0_DEV`, `VROUTER_LB0_SERVER0_IP`, `VROUTER_LB0_SERVER0_CHECK0_TYPE`
    	* *Limitation of 9 LoadBallancers on one vrouter instance each with max 9 real servers. This can be enhanced in context scripts in future.*
    5. Iptables and Keepalived IPv6 support - for this time just in dual stack IPv4+IPv6
    
    **There are prepared context vars in template, so you just need define right values**
